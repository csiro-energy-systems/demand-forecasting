# Demand Forecasting for Electric Vehicles (EV)

This project focuses on developing various tools for energy demand forecasting, specifically tailored for electric vehicles (EV). The goal is to accurately predict the energy demand of EVs to optimize energy distribution, improve grid stability, and support the integration of renewable energy sources.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of historical energy consumption data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implementation of machine learning models to forecast future energy demands based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing energy consumption trends and forecasting results to aid in interpretation and decision-making.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Algorithms to optimize energy distribution based on forecasted demand, aiming to enhance grid efficiency and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
